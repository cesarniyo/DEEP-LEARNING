# DEEP-LEARNING
This Microsoft Capstone project's goal is to build a deep learning model to predict the types of appliances (Labels) from 
spectrograms of current and voltage measurements (Images). A spectrogram is a visual representation of the various frequencies of 
sound as they vary with time. 

The project is organized into following parts:

    Introduction
    Importing Libaries
    Loading Images
    Create training data
    Preprocessing Training Data
    Data Normalization and Spriting
    Building the Model (MLP Model)
    Evaluating the MLP Model
    Building the Model (CNN Model)
    Evaluating the CNN Model
    Saving the built Model
    Loading and Predicting with the new Built Model
    Making Prediction on Testing Data
    Conclusion
